# 🚀 Full Stack Project Collection (Node.js / Express / React / MongoDB)

Welcome to my **Project Repository**, a single place where I upload and manage all my **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Full-Stack** projects.
Each folder inside this repo represents a **standalone project** that can run independently with its own setup and dependencies.

---

## 🧩 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

* 💼 A **personal project archive** for backend and full-stack apps
* 📚 A **learning hub** for mastering real-world development
* 🧠 A **reference base** for interview prep and technical practice
* 🧰 A **code library** for scalable app structures (MVC, REST API, Auth, etc.)

---
Each project has its own **`.env`** and **`server.js`** file to stay independent.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack Overview

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
* **Authentication:** JWT & Cookies
* **Frontend (where used):** EJS / React
* **Other Tools:** dotenv, bcrypt, method-override, cookie-parser

## 🌱 Future Additions

* 📦 REST API projects
* 🌐 React frontends integrated with backend APIs
* 🔐 Advanced authentication systems (OAuth, 2FA)
* 🧠 Mini clones & SaaS-style apps
