🚀 Full Stack Project Collection (Node.js / Express / React / MongoDB)

Welcome to my Project Repository, a single place where I upload and manage all my Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Full-Stack projects.
Each folder inside this repo represents a standalone project that can run independently with its own setup and dependencies.

🧩 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

💼 A personal project archive for backend and full-stack apps

📚 A learning hub for mastering real-world development

🧠 A reference base for interview prep and technical practice

🧰 A code library for scalable app structures (MVC, REST API, Auth, etc.)
